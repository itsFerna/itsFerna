## 🧱 Other Skills

### 🎨 Design & 3D
Even though I don’t use Figma, I create assets using:

- Blender (3D modeling, small animations, rendering)
- Video & motion design tools (After Effects, Premiere, CapCut)
- Digital drawing tools (Procreate, Affinity)
- Audio design (FL Studio)


This helps me build apps with beautiful motion and clean visual experiences.
